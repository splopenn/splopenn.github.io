**Don't use Calibri for your résumé!** Here's why...

I have been applying to technical writing jobs for a few months now with suboptimal results.
Since I started applying, I have:
- Refreshed my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slpennington/)
- Updated my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/slpwrites)
- Read technical writing blogs ([passo.uno](https://passo.uno/) is my favorite)
- Written an entire software documentation [module](https://docs.evergreen-ils.org/docs/latest/staff_catalog/introduction.html)
- Designed and co-edited a [magazine](https://issuu.com/lightsandshadows/docs/lights_and_shadows_62)
- Built this blog

One thing I *haven't* done is optimize my résumé for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

Thankfully, my résumé is already a [single column](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/s2b37q/if_youre_applying_online_use_a_single_column/) -- so no changes there!

But there is one big problem. When I ran a pdf of my résumé through my university's AI-powered résumé checker from VMock, something very concerning happened...

![Website flagging spelling errors that don't appear in the résumé. For example, it reads "ti" as "Q," making "information" become "informaQon."](/images/resume-errors.png)

The software flags spelling errors that aren't actually there throughout my résumé! I think this website is very similar to ATS's, so I suspect this issue may cause my résumé to be screened out.

I've also been editing and re-saving the same document for months now, so I took this chance to start from scratch. Here's what I did:
1. Created a blank Word document and set up all of my style formats *first* instead of making them up as I go.
2. Typed my résumé completely from scratch -- no copy-paste.
3. Changed the body font from 12-point Calibri to 11-point Arial.

Here's the result:

I'm pretty confident the font change made the most difference for this issue. However, it is possible that some invisible error in formatting was causing problems. I now also have a résumé document that will be much easier to edit.

So here's the big lesson -- **don't use Calibri for your résumé**! 

For functional documents like this, I usually don't spend much time worrying about font beyond ensuring it is legible and widely compatible. However, in the era of AI, LLM's, and ATS's, there's much more to consider...
