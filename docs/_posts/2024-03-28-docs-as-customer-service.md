My library’s patron catalog is hard to use for most people. The main thing that trips folks up is that they have to choose their library from a drop-down menu at the end of the search row. I know that sounds simple, but by default the catalog searches every library in the state &mdash; so patrons spend a lot of time scouring our shelves for books we don’t actually own. 

But there is hope. At the bottom of the page you can select “How to Use the Catalog,” which takes you to a series of videos that teach everything you need to know. 

Though &mdash; I have never heard of a patron using that. 

So, even though the process is well-documented, the documentation is not providing great customer service. It could.

# First Line of Defense

Good, user-focused docs can be a “first line of defense” in customer service. It’s not that I want to avoid customers &mdash; rather, I want it to be as easy as possible for them to use the product. (And [deflect some tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408885934234-Lesson-4-Helping-customers-help-themselves) at the same time...)

Instead of videos, or in addition to, maybe our catalog needs a banner at the top of the results page asking whether they are looking in the right place with a link to a short, clear explanation of how to run a search. (There are only four fields, it can be quick!)

That helps users engage with the catalog, and, therefore, our library. 

# Better User Experience

When patrons or customers can help themselves, it creates a [better overall user experience](https://www.qminder.com/blog/customer-service/benefits-self-service/). Don’t get me wrong, a phone call is great — but that takes up two people’s time and has potential to go wrong. 

Docs aren’t emotional. And they have all the time in the world. Further, if a patron can help themselves, they get more confident, and they’re more likely to keep using the library. 

I think the same applies in a lot of places. 

For instance, I learned how to build this website, but some parts of the documentation are outdated or unclear. The temptation to pivot to another platform, or give up entirely, can be strong. 

Similarly, a patron frustrated with the catalog may be unwilling to use it. Then, they’ll have a harder time finding books they like. Over time, it’s easy to see how we can lose a patron due to a problem that could be solved with better docs. 

# More Revenue

Better docs -> better experience -> more money. (Or, in the library’s case, circulations, which in turn can lead to more money!)

Maybe you think the relationship between docs and revenue is tenuous at best. The product leads to revenue, right?

But consider this: if you’re using a new product, how many obstacles or roadblocks will you tolerate before you give up on it? It’s different for everyone, and depends on the product, but everyone has a number. 

And it’s no secret that a lost customer is lost revenue, but a loyal customer can give revenue indefinitely. 

Even if you don't buy that, I think we can at least agree that [good docs save money](https://www.qminder.com/blog/customer-service/benefits-self-service/#3-reduced-costs).
