I'm Spencer Pennington, an [underscore-shaped](https://nested.substack.com/p/short-fat-engineers-are-undervalued) technical writer, editor, and designer. Right now, I'm working in a library while I complete my MA in Technical Writing &mdash; but don't let that fool you. In my three years in libraries, I've written manuals, reports, proposals, [user-friendly software documentation](https://docs.evergreen-ils.org/docs/3.12/staff_catalog/introduction.html), and much more.

I believe in AsciiDoc and the Oxford comma. I read and [write](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bOvLhhfvIzQBTNcl1xKwKwDEtjUo0acr/view) fiction. My favorite part of a board game is the rulebook. And I love helping people and solving problems.

And by the way: Yes, I do think [you need a technical writer](https://passo.uno/signs-need-tech-writer/).
