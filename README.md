# Welcome!

This is the repository for my GitHub Pages site, using Jekyll. 

Right now, you can find a blog feed and brief About page.

If you haven't read the About page yet, I'm a technical writer and a regular-old writer. The point of this site is to keep a log of my journey as a technical writer and serve as a home for my resume and portfolio. (I'm also using it to practice some coding skills...)

## The future holds...

Eventually I'll work on some of the following projects on this site:
1. Change and customize the theme.
2. Add a resume page.
3. Add a portfolio page.
4. Who knows what else...

I'm also hoping to learn enough code to be [dangerous](http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/), so stay tuned for some supremely basic coding projects.
